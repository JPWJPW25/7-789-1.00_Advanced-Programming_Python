## Project description
Welcome to the document similarity checker. The program lets you compare two documents and compute their similarity. 
Based on the similarity you can for example identify plagiats or copies of text that just have been modified by changing word orders.


## Dependencies 
Please install the following libraries to make the code work
```bash
pip install scikit-learn
pip install nltk
pip install pdfplumber
pip install docx2txt
pip install seaborn
```
## Structure of the program

Part 1) Import packages and specific functions

Part 2) Define functions to convert PDF or Word files to text files

Part 3) File handling functions for text files

Part 4) Define tokenizer and respective functions for data preprocessing

Part 5) Define vectorizer and consine similarity calculator

Part 6) Main program divided into 15 steps
